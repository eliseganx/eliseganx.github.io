1. My page passes the HTML5 and CSS specifications. I have more than 5 rules in my CSS file; though, I'm not completely sure whether or not there was a more efficient way to achieve the same style. I don't use styling elements in HTML, only CSS, and I don't use anny styling attributes in elements. I also don't use Javascript or Bootstrap.

2. I googled a few CSS elements, like centering the bulleted list.

3. About 3 hours
